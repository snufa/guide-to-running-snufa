# A guide to running SNUFA

This site explains how we run the [SNUFA](https://snufa.net) annual online workshop, so that others can easily re-use it.

Note that although there's quite a few steps to learn the first time you run it, the second time onwards it is very low effort in terms of hours. Also, the cost is negligible.
